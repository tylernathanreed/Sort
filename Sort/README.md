Sort-Java
=========

Contains the Sorting Algorithms implemented using Java.

For the source code of each Algorithm, see `./src/Sort/<Algorithm>`

<hr>

Each Sort Class within Java using the <T extends Comparable<? super T>> generics, meaning "Some element that is comparable with itself or anything that is derived from itself". This ensures that the algorithm may be used on numbers, strings, and anything else that is inheritly comparable to itself.
